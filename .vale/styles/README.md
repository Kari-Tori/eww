# Vale styles

This directory is intentionally empty. Download or create Vale style bundles from https://github.com/errata-ai/styles and place them here (for example `./.vale/styles/Microsoft/`).

The repository includes a minimal `.vale.ini` pointing to this directory so Vale will not fail due to missing configuration.
